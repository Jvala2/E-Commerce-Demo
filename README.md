My motivation for making this project was to emulate the backend of an ecommerce website.

Mainly this has been created so that in the future, when people ask me if I can code a backed for say Amazon, I can direct them to this.

This allows people to search for products in a database by product id, internal id, categories and so forth.

One big thing I learned in the structure of RESTapis, and how to handle them properly.
